# EHGNN

An implementation for the paper--Efficient Learning for Billion-scale Heterogeneous Information Networks.

### Dataset

The three datasets used in the paper (PubMed, Yelp and DBLP) can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/186u90Y0gzmdI-R6gQEOis1Nip6G759rv?usp=drive_link). In addition, the OGB-MAG240M dataset can be found [here](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/mag240m/). Please place the downloaded datasets in the `../data`.

### Usage

To conduct the experiments, please execute `main.py` in each folder (Node Classification, Link Prediction, and MAG240M). Hyperparameters can be explored within the `main.py`.
